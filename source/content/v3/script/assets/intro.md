  seoDesc: Load what you need on demand to optimize page speed and preserve bandwidth with Wee's asset loader.

Don't embed assets on requests where they aren't needed, or needed immediately. Load what you need on demand to optimize page speed and preserve bandwidth. You can asynchronously (or synchronously) load scripts as well as CSS and images. Work with groups and callbacks to solve complex problems.

With [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards), you can attach photos and other media to Tweets that drive traffic to your website.

```html
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary">
<meta name="twitter:site" content="@weecss">
```

**Note:** Twitter cards can work in conjunction with Open Graph to eliminate duplicate tag content.

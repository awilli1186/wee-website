Whether someone is on a mobile device, legacy browser, or Windows tablet your brand should stay consistent. In addition to the iOS and Safari icons the `browserconfig.xml` and `favicon.ico` files serve most environments.

```html
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/assets/img/icons/touch.png">
<link rel="mask-icon" href="/assets/img/icons/pin.svg" color="#349bb9">
```

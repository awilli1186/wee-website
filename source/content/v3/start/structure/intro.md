Wee begins with a [Less](http://lesscss.org/) stylesheet full of variables, a browser reset, a set of [mixins](/style/mixins) and [classes](/style/classes), and base styling. You also get example [HTML5](/start/markup), an [.htaccess](#htaccess), sample favicons, [robots](#robots)/[humans](#humans).txt files, a robust [JavaScript library](/script), and a style guide template. Use it all or just parts, your choice.

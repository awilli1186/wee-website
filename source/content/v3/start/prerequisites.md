The first dependency is [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org). If it's already installed run `node -v` to check the version and compare it against the latest stable release. If you don't get a response or have an outdated version, download and install the latest release. Node also includes [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) (Node Package Manager) which is used to install Wee's dependencies.

Next install the Wee CLI (Command Line Interface) from npm by running `npm install -g wee-cli`. This allows you to [build your project](/build) and [execute commands](/build/commands).

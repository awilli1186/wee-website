Wee leverages [JSHint](http://jshint.com) and [JSCS](http://jscs.info) for automatic and manual code validation. JSHint serves as more of a high-level quality check and JSCS is focused on code consistency and formatting. In `wee.json` you can disable either independently or point them to custom paths.

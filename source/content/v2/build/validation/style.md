Wee doesn't currently support automated CSS testing in the build process or validation task. However, Wee does ship with both [CSScomb](http://csscomb.com) and [CSSLint](http://csslint.net) files in the project root that reflect the internal Wee standards. These can be used along with code editor plugins to validate your stylesheets.

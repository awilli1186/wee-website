We're excited to push this latest Wee release. There are some key improvements we've already been making use of internally. We plan one more minor release of Wee 3 and then we'll be shifting focus to some of the exciting Wee 4 features we've been planning.

###### Here are some of the major updates:

* Added namespace to Wee screen to allow granular reset of rules
* Added support for SVG class manipulation
* Allow setting root datastore arrays and objects
* Format task path conditionally to support npm 3 structural support
* Rename package to wee-framework to avoid npm collision and allow for npm installation

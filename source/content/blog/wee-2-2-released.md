It's only been a few weeks since Wee 2.1 was released but we've worked through the bug reports and completed our target enhancements for 2.2 ahead of schedule.

###### Here are some of the highlights:

* Added the ability to set the offset with the [offset()](/script/dom#offset) method to bring parity with jQuery
* Added chainable [add()](/script/chain#dom) method
* Added stopPropagation support for IE8
* Created [vertical-align](/style/mixins#alignment) mixin
* Added ability to get all data attributes by only providing a selector to [$data](/script/dom#data)
* Updated [Wee.assets.ready()](/script/assets#ready) to return a boolean representing if the group is loaded if the options are undefined
* Added support for woff2 with corresponding variable toggle, disabled by default but will be enabled in Wee 3

To read the full changelog take a look at the [release notes](https://github.com/weepower/wee/releases/tag/2.2.0). We have one more release planned for Wee 2, then we'll be focusing on the exciting enhancements scheduled for Wee 3. To view more check out our [trello board](https://trello.com/b/7KbnQra9/wee).

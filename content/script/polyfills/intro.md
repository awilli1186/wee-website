  seoTitle: JavaScript Polyfills
  deoDesc: Wee patches legacy browsers for a consistent JavaScript API by using a collection of polyfills to support HTML5, ES5, placeholders, SVGs, and more.

Polyfills can be used to patch any number of browser incompatibilities and inconsistencies. Wee ships with a few that we think come in handy but if you don't need them just remove them from your project.json build object and the polyfill directory.

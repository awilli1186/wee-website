Wee seamlessly syncs breakpoint changes between your CSS and script. A simple numeric value system is pulled from the responsive Less breakpoints you [configure](https://www.weepower.com/start/compiling#project-json). By pooling callbacks together in a common resize event browser resource usage is limited.

Wee starts with a [Less](http://lesscss.org/)-based stylesheet full of variables, a browser reset, a set of [mixins](/style/mixins) and [classes]((/style/classes)), and base styling. You also get example HTML5, an [.htaccess](#htaccess), sample favicons, [robots](#robots)/[humans](#humans).txt files, and a robust JavaScript library. Use it all or just parts, your choice.

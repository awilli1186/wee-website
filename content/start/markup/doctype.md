The doctype is a critical tag because it tells the browser which standard to use when rendering your website. Wee uses [HTML5](http://diveintohtml5.info/), the modern standard for structuring data on the web which includes a number of [new elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/HTML5_element_list).

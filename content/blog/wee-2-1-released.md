2.1 marks a major milestone for Wee and brings some exciting new features. It's been 5 months since Wee 2.0.5 was released but we've been hard at work with over 200 commits and endless hours of polishing.

###### Here are some of the highlights:

* Added a new [static site generator](/generator)
* Added [validation options](/build/validation) for JavaScript
* Added an advanced JavaScript [template rendering engine](/script/view)
* Added an [update check](/build/#tasks) Grunt task
* The [$setRef](/script/core#setref) method is executed by default making all data-ref elements available in the global ref storage
* Updated the Wee website with an improved design along with better documentation and examples

We also fixed over a dozen bugs, worked to bring parity with [Wee DOM](/script/dom) and jQuery, and deprecated a number of mixins and functions that don't align the the simplicity of Wee. Most importantly we've introduced additional consistency and stability to the core that we can continue to build on. This is just the start and we're excited about our next major release.

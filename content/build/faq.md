### What is Grunt?

[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) is an automated build tool. Wee uses Grunt to watch and compile your 
project as you go.

### What is Node?

Grunt is built on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org), which is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

As noted in the Installation section, you will need to have it installed to run the Grunt compiler.
